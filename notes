parsing

event handling

render

ok so I-m gonna get a input like

./fractol julia 9 2

parsing - receber os args, error handle, etc

grid handling: [0, 1980] becomes [-2, 2]

init window
init image
loop thru pixels
	img_pixel_put
image_to_window


What is the image?
What are the two pointers in the image struct?
- The get_addr pointer is the pointer to the first pixel in the array of pixels.
- The pointer from mlx_new_image is... what?
